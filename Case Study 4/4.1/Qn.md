Case Study 4(i) â€“ Price Update

Implement additional pages to perform database management functions such as product price update and generation of daily sales report.

On clicking a corresponding check box, the user can key in the new sales price for a cup of coffee. On successful update of the sales price into the database, the updated sale prices should be automatically retrieved and display onto the same page for user confirmation.

How to implement?
check to disable 'readonly' of price

submit button:
updates price = newprice
uncheck to set price as 'readonly'
sets price = new price
